# firstproject

This is the first thing on GitHub that I'm upolading. (Yes, there where some before, but now I finally figured out how to upload with Visual studios. Bah.)

I'm trying to learn C#, hoping to be able to write mods for games, but also because I want to work as a system developer. 

I followed this tutorial:

And got some help from:
